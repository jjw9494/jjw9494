I am an aspiring software engineer currently studying through the School of Code. 

In the future I look forward to challenging myself and would like to not only become proficient in high-level languages and frameworks, but I would also like to become a polyglot, developing skills across low-level languages and I hope to develop an adaptable skillset that will allow me to tackle whatever challenges I may come across.

I also pride myself on my communication and leadership abilities. Growing up within a military environment and attending a military school there was an emphasis on cultivating these skills and I would love the opportunity to develop further.

Outside of tech I am an award winning writer, I have had my music played at clubs around the world and when I can find the time I also enjoy painting.
